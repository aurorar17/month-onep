# FIRST MONTH PROJECT

## Description
I am attending a Web Development course at Tamwood International College and this project is based on the instructions of the Month one project and assignement. 

### Project
I created a web site for the restaurant owned by my dad. 

On the home page at the top there is a navigation bar containing everything a potential consumer might want to know: the menu, contacts (email, phone number and address), a form for booking a table and other information about the restaurant.

In the footer there is an item containing the location of the restaurant on Google Maps and the opening hours of the restaurant.

### Credits
All the photos that are present are taken by me, except one for which I write the credits below.
