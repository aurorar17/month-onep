# FIRST MONTH PROJECT

## Description
I am attending a Web Development course at Tamwood International College and this project is based on the instructions of the Month one project and assignement. 

### Project
I created a web site for a restaurant owned by my dad. 
All the photos that are present are taken by me, except one for which I write the credits below.
